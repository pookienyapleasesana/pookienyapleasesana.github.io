            - What is climate change?<br>
            - What causes climate change?<br>
            - How does climate change affect the environment?<br>
            - What are the consequences of climate change for humans?<br>
            - Can we still mitigate climate change?<br><br>
         
            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in weather patterns and average temperatures on Earth. It encompasses changes in temperature, precipitation, sea levels, and other factors, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.<br>
            The primary cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), primarily from human activities like burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, industrial processes, and deforestation.<br>
            Climate change affects human health, food security, water resources, economies, and livelihoods. It can exacerbate poverty, increase the risk of natural disasters, displacement, and conflict, and disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and regions.<br>
        Mitigation efforts involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, adopting sustainable land-use practices, and promoting conservation and reforestation. Mitigation actions aim to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in international <br>
